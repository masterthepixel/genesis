                    building conception and initiation. The owner initiates the idea
                    and gathers his team of experts (design, contractor, trades). Collectively, the team decides whether
                    or not
                    a project is feasible and if they can realistically complete it within the desired timeframe. This
                    means
                    gathering a team of trusted partners together to do meticulous research to determine the scope and
                    cost of a
                    project.</p>

                    thumbs-up, a plan needs to be outlined and put into writing. Having a written plan helps ensure that
                    everyone on the team is on the same page and understands the steps that they must take to complete
                    the
                    project effectively. During this step in the construction project’s life cycle, many of the
                    fundamental best
                    practices for project management in construction are utilized in this phase.</p>

                <p class="leading-tight tracking-normal md:text-lg xl:text-lg">The next step in the construction project
                    life
                    cycle is the actual execution based on your comprehensive plan developed in the previous step. This
                    stage is
                    where the team collectively develops deliverables to satisfy the customer. This is where the magic
                    happens
                    and the project comes to life. Using the plan as the project guide, team members assign specific
                    tasks for
                    completion and allocates resources accordingly. Some of the specific tasks during this phase
                    include:
                    assigning teams, executing project management plans, conducting status meetings, updating project
                    schedule,

                <p class="leading-tight tracking-normal md:text-lg xl:text-lg">This stage of the project life cycle is
                    all
                    about monitoring. Project performance and control goes hand in hand with the previous step because
                    they
                    occur simultaneously. During this construction project phase, project managers track a project’s
                    progress.
                    Many times the project manager must make several adjustments to keep a project on track. Specific
                    key
                    performance (or project) indicators (KPI’s) for cost, time and quality are selected and utilized.
                    These KPIs
                    determine degrees of variation from the original project goal. </p>

                </h3>
                <p class="leading-tight tracking-normal md:text-lg xl:text-lg">Once the team executes all the
                    deliverables
                    and delivers it to the satisfaction of the customer, they can close the project. When the team
                    officially
                    completes the project, we move into the final stage of the construction project life cycle. This
                    last step
                    is vitally important because it allows team members to evaluate, document and learn from the
                    project.
                    Project Close helps members determine what issues they had so that they can make improvements in the
                    future. A final team meeting is usually held and led by a project manager to officially mark the
                    ending of
                    the project. Valuable team members are rewarded and recognized, contractors are terminated, and
                    project
                    successes and failures are identified. Also, project managers must create a final project budget and
                    report to close out the project.</p>

                <p class="leading-tight tracking-normal md:text-lg xl:text-lg">Construction projects are complex which
                    makes
                    project management in construction equally complex. Project managers are the critical piece of this
                    complex puzzle. Therefore, understanding the different construction project phases helps to ensure
                    the
                    process is much easier and efficient. The most important thing is to include the primary
                    stakeholders
                    including subcontractors as early in the project as possible. While each phase serves an important
                    function, the most thoroughly planned projects are often the easiest and fastest to execute.</p>
